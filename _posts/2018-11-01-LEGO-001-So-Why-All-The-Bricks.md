I found out that one of my managers has recently read part of my blog. And he was curious as to what it is about all these bricks.

Well, its Simple. I live my life in IT through Bricks, small segments of work that can be repeated and adapted easily. From the use of Functions in scripts to Work packages of sequential tasks, everything we do in IT comes down to bricks.

And when you look at a system like SCCM its all about putting a plinth, a heap of bricks in the middle, and a Cap Stone on top. this makes a column of work made up of heaps of bricks.

Same with Task Sequences in SCCM. You start off with a base. Add in the Brick for your operating system, add the bricks for drivers, and some more bricks for hardware applications and then add bricks for other applications. Add in some more bricks for base customisations and you end up with a repeatable process of bricks.

Then you get a new version of Windows, replace the brick with the next version of Windows and maybe replace a few bricks for the hardware drivers and applications, but the process remains the same.

When you look at other things we do it is all able to be made into Bricks. Small discrete pieces of work.

And then when you get time in your job or time in those late nights in front of your keyboard, you make those bricks do the work themselves by automating the Brick by using other bricks. That's right reusing code from previous work to make new Automation Bricks.

So to my Manager, Bricks is how I see things, a Brick here and there. There is not much you can do that cannot be related to a Brick. Besides LEGO rules!
